sl_delayHauntedKitchen	boolean	Should we delay the Haunted Kitchen until we have 9 resist? (Or in Ed, Even More Elemental Wards)?

sl_getDinseyGarbageMoney	boolean	Spend a few turns getting the easy FunBucks during a run?
sl_borrowedTimeOnLiberation	boolean	Automatically use Borrowed Time when liberating the King? This assumes that you are going to bother to ascend again the same day.
sl_clearCombatScripts	boolean	Clear out the postAdventure, preAdventure and kingLiberated settings upon kingLiberation. These will return upon running the script in a new ascension.

sl_stayInRun	boolean	If true, we stop when the King can be freed but do not free the King. Paths with a choice at liberation time will always stayInRun regardless of this setting.
sl_confidence	boolean	If true, we'll get the confidence buff instead of breaking the mirror. Good if your combat suite isn't very fleshed out yet, since it makes the Naughty Sorceress dramatically easier.
sl_teaChoice	string	When using the tea tree, grab this 'tea'. Must use a string that acceptable to Mafia's 'teatree' command (Use ; to separate by daycount, leave blank to skip a day).
sl_floundryChoice	string	Force floundry usage. Must use the item name (Use ; to separate by daycount, leave blank to skip a day).
sl_xiblaxianChoice	string	When using Xiblaxian Stuff, do we make a Xiblaxian Ultraburrito or Xiblaxian Space-Whiskey
sl_extrudeChoice	string	: separated by day, ; separated by order. Use food, booze. Defaults to booze for any empty fields.
sl_mummeryChoice	string	Force mummery usage. Use familiar name and goals are in order (1..7) (Use ; to separate, leave blank to skip a goal).
sl_blacklistFamiliar	string	A semi-colon separate string of familiar names that we do not want to use. They still may get used but this will minimize their usage.
sl_doArtistQuest	boolean	If set, we will try to do the artist quest. If the artist is not-accessible, the setting will silently disable.
sl_ashtonLimit	integer	If set, makes sure you save X of an item before feeding it to the Ashton Kutcher (ignores Soda Bread).
sl_limitConsume	boolean	When false, pull cheapish food/booze when we run low so we can continue.
sl_maximize_baseline	string	The string to use as the baseline for the maximizer when deciding gear. If this is blank or "default", it will use a generated maximizer statement that takes your current situation in to account somewhat. If you set it to "disabled" it will revert to the old equipment system, for now.

sl_saveSausage	boolean	When true, in HCCS, do not eat the Sausage Without A Cause (may cause you to eat nothing on day 2).
sl_saveVintage	boolean	When true, in HCCS, do not drink the Vintage Smart Drink (will cause +lbs quest to take 4 more adventures).
sl_saveMagicalSausage	boolean	When true, don't eat magical sausage, so you can save them up for aftercore.
sl_useWishes	boolean	When true, use the Genie Bottle to go faster in non-Community Service runs.
sl_spoonsign	string	What sign to change to with the hewn moon-rune spoon after finishing any business in the current sign. If blank or invalid, we won't switch automatically. Can be set to any of the 9 main sign names, or knoll/canadia/gnomad to automatically select the appropriate sign within that zone based on your mainstat. Also some shorthands are allowed in case you forgot which moonsign is which, such as famweight/clover/food/booze. You will be prompted to confirm that you actually do want to change signs automatically once per ascension (although it will automatically assume that you do after 15 seconds of inactivity), so forgetting to change the value in advance should not be a concern.
sl_beta_test	boolean	Occasionally I might need to make big changes, but not want to do so without some broader testing. If you're a kind, generous soul, you can test these features by setting this to true! sl_beta_test will be mentioned in the change logs whenever there is something to test, and mentioned again when that feature stops being a beta feature.
sl_legacyConsumeStuff	boolean	When true, use the old heuristic-based consumption strategy instead of the new solver that tries to pack as many adventures into your organs as possible. Not used in CS or Ed.
sl_helpMeMafiaIsSuperBrokenAaah	boolean	Pretty much just for werebear. If for some reason you find that mafia completely fails to detect item drops occasionally, leading to wasting a ton of adventures continuing to look for an item you already found, try this out.
