# NOTICE THE SECOND

I've decided to re-evaluate my previous decision, which is detailed in the notice below. I have
decided upon further thinking to attempt to divorce my opinion of the developer(s) from my opinion
of the game. I missed the community and the game, and especially scripting for the game too much to
stay away any longer.

However! In my absence, sl\_ascend has been forked [here](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/autoscend)
under the new name autoscend. I was never terribly fond of the name sl\_ascend anyway, I just chose
it out of laziness, and several months of updates can be found there, so when I resume contributing
to automated ascending of KoL, it will be in the form of pull requests to that project.

# NOTICE

sl\_ascend is no longer being maintained as of September 7th 2019.
The developer and the most active contributor have agreed that neither of us wish to support
the game in the way that we have any longer.

This is because of the [actions of Jick and some of the other developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kol/comments/d0cq9s/allegations_of_misconduct_by_asymmetric_members/)
that have recently come to light.

On the off chance that the above linked reddit thread is no longer available for some reason or
another, here is a [direct link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLNbjQD2V9uVUPBDu0q7Ox6zC03-BVSBgI_0t7tpUxo/edit) to a google doc containing the relevant information.

I still love KoL, and the KoL community as a whole, but I do not wish to support the game with
scripts any longer. In my case, and the case of many others, the game would not be nearly as
enjoyable without the scripting community. In that sense, creating scripts contributes to the game's
success. I cannot personally rationalize supporting a game that belongs almost solely to one person
when I would never want to support that person.

## The future

Obviously sl\_ascend itself will no longer be receiving updates. But anyone is free to fork
sl\_ascend and resume development. The only request I make is that you rename the script itself and
the script files to no longer start with sl\_. Also, please rename all the preferences used by the
script to not start with sl\_ as well. I'd also appreciate it if you renamed the functions used by
the script that start with sl or sl\_ in a like fashion, but I'm not going to insist on it.

# sl\_ascend

sl\_ascend is a script that will play through an entire ascension for you in the Kingdom of Loathing.
It is built up from cc\_ascend.

## Installation

Run this command in the graphical CLI:
<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/soolar/sl_ascend/trunk/RELEASE/
</pre>
Will require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

## Usage

Just type sl\_ascend in the gCLI! You can configure sl\_ascend in the relay browser via the relay
script soolascend. If you ever want to interrupt the script, please use the interrupt button in
the soolascend relay script rather than terminating via mafia with escape. Otherwise certain settings
may not be restored properly to their pre-run values.

## Requirements

There are a couple specific requirements to run sl\_ascend effectively. If you run in to issues in
a path that allows access to your normally permed skills, don't report them if you don't have these
skills permed:

* Saucestorm
* Cannelloni Cocoon

Other things that help greatly but shouldn't be strictly required (I think):

* Curse of Weaksauce + Itchy Curse Finger
* Stuffed Mortar Shell
* Saucegeyser

## Community Service

If you want to run HCCS, the recommended setup is Sauceror with all of the skills mentioned in the
requirements section. Other classes should work as well, but Sauceror works best.

## Two Crazy Random Summer

The recommended class/sign combination for running sl\_ascend in TCRS is Sauceror/Blender.
Other signs should work okay too, but they won't have any special support (like automatic diet,
or using certain nice cheap potions).

## Warning

I'm still new to this codebase, so I can't be 100% confident that I am not making any mistakes.
cc\_ascend was broken at the start of the year (2019) by some changes to the game, which I believe
I have fixed the script to handle, but I'm not 100% sure it will handle all aspects of the game
perfectly yet...

Basically, your ascension may or may not break in spectacular ways! Sorry in advance if that happens!

Also, at the moment you will probably have to handle the vast majority of your diet manually.
At least, in hardcore standard, anyway.

## Issues?

Please do create github issues for any problems you run in to. I make no promises about how fast
I'll be to handle them, but I'll try to fix reasonable problems in a reasonable timeframe.

If you really need a quick answer about something, feel free to kmail me in game at
Soolar the Second (#2463557), but be warned that not even I fully understand this code base
at the moment, so I might not be able to help!

You can also come discuss problems with the script on the [#sl\_ascend channel on the Ascension Speed Society discord server](https://discord.gg/96xZxv3), or just discuss the script in general!

Some people maintain a list of common problems, solutions, and tips on writing a bug report [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfyKDHSDl-fogGSeNXTwbC6A06BG-gTkXUAdUta9_Ns).

## Special Thanks

This script would obviously not be possible without the work of Cheesecookie.
He did by far the majority of the work. So thanks a bunch to Cheesecookie!
